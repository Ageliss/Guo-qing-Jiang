I received my Ph.D degree of "Climate Sciences" at School of Physics([page](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/)) of [PekingUniversity](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) supervised by Prof. Jun Wei([page](http://www.atmos.pku.edu.cn/en/Faculty/Fulltimefaculty/64750.htm)). During my Ph.D career, I visited [EAPS](https://eapsweb.mit.edu/) of [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/) for one year, hosted by Prof. Paola Malanotte-Rizzoli([page](http://web.mit.edu/rizzoli/Public/)).

My research spans hurricane, climate, physical ocean and AI. I focus on theoritically understanding the generalization of deep learning and applying ML to climate-ocean and hurricane (typhoon) prediction problems. I enjoyed making applications of AI and ML on climate, physical ocean, natural disasters, and so on.

I am working on a number of cross-projects in climate change, physic ocean, and CS. They usually involve coding in Python, Fortran and Pytorch. My detailed education and experience can be found in [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guoqing-jiang-780a5bb2/).

<!-- Education
---------

2010-2014 (expected)
:   **PhD, Computer Science**; Awesome University (MyTown)

    *Thesis title: Deep Learning Approaches to the Self-Awesomeness
     Estimation Problem*

2007-2010
:   **BSc, Computer Science and Electrical Engineering**; University of
    HomeTown (HomeTown)

    *Minor: Awesomeology*

Experience
----------

**Your Most Recent Work Experience:**

Short text containing the type of work done, results obtained,
lessons learned and other remarks. Can also include lists and
links:

* First item

* Item with [link](http://www.example.com). Links will work both in
  the html and pdf versions.

**That Other Job You Had**

Also with a short description.

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Research:
----------------------------------------
I'm interested in AI, climate science and physical ocean. My current focus is on deep learning theory and applying deep learning methods to the climate-ocean models.

7.[Understanding Why Neural Networks Generalize Well Through GSNR of Parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07384)

Jinlong Liu, **Guoqing Jiang**, Yunzhi Bai, Ting Chen, Huayan Wang (2020)

Based on several approximations, we establish a quantitative relationship between model parameters' GSNR and the generalization gap. This relationship indicates that larger GSNR during training process leads to better generalization performance. Moreover, different from that of shallow models (e.g. logistic regression, support vector machines), the gradient descent optimization dynamics of DNNs naturally produces large GSNR during training, which is probably the key to DNNs' remarkable generalization ability.

6.[Seasonal and interannual variability of the subsurface velocity profile of the Indonesian Throughflow at Makassar Strait](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018JC014884)

**Guo‐Qing Jiang**, Jun Wei, Paola Malanotte‐Rizzoli, Mingting Li, Arnold L Gordon (2019)

The seasonal variability of the depth of the ITF velocity maximum is partially controlled by the seasonally reversed Karimata throughflow, while the remainder primarily originated from the Mindanao–Sulawesi inflow rather than the Sibutu Strait throughflow.

Mingting Li, Jun Wei, Dongxiao Wang, Arnold L Gordon, Song Yang, Paola Malanotte‐Rizzoli, **Guoqing Jiang** (2019)

Closing the Sibutu Strait reduces the Luzon Strait throughflow into the SCS by 75%, and the Mindoro–Sibutu deep exchange is reversed, thus flowing into the SCS. No significant change occurs over the shallow Sunda Shelf of the southern SCS, which is primarily driven by local monsoon winds.

Mingting Li, Arnold L Gordon, Jun Wei, Laura K Gruenburg, **Guoqing Jiang** (2018)

NCEP reanalysis wind data from 1948 to 2016 and Makassar Strait transport from 2004 to 2011 are used to construct a multi-decadal timeseries of 0–300 m Makassar Throughflow using a back-propagation (BP) neural network.

3.[A deep learning algorithm of neural network for the parameterization of typhoon‐ocean feedback in typhoon forecast models](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2018GL077004)

**Guo‐Qing Jiang**, Jing Xu, Jun Wei (2018)

Two algorithms based on machine learning neural networks are proposed—the shallow learning (S‐L) and deep learning (D‐L) algorithms—that can potentially be used in atmosphere‐only typhoon forecast models to provide flow‐dependent typhoon‐induced sea surface temperature cooling (SSTC) for improving typhoon predictions.

Jun Wei, Xin Liu, **Guoqing Jiang** (2018)

Combining a linear regression and a temperature budget formula, a multivariate regression model is proposed to parameterize and estimate sea surface temperature (SST) cooling induced by tropical cyclones (TCs).
